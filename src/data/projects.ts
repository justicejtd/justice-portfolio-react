      "I (project manager) worked with Justice on an expansion of an already existing React Native project that he was unfamiliar with when he started. However, both during and in the week following the kickoff for the project, he asked all the right questions. He asked about the backstory, the goal of both the current project as well as the value of the expansion and the preferred way for me to communicate during the project so both our time would be used optimally. His skill and knowledge proved on par, where he basically delivered exactly what was asked. Additionally, he challenged me on certain choices that were  made before development and offered alternative solutions that actually made more sense and basically could be done in the same amount of time. Needless to say, the project was a success. How I experienced Justice on the workfloor is a person who keeps to himself most of the time, but uses that time to both work hard on development and improve his skill set.",
