            I am a software engineer specialized in Mobile development.
            Developing software applications is something that I am enthusiastic
            about, especially when it comes to building mobile apps. I have
            experience in building Android and cross platform applications. For
            example, I have built and worked on a HR onboarding chatbot,
            maintenance app for agriculture measuring devices, Global Talk Care
            App and Slam Fm Radio app. Each of these apps were developed with
            one of the following technologies: React Native, Kotlin or Flutter.
            My ambition as a developer is to strive for quality over quantity by
            following best code practices and architecture patterns like MVVM,
            DI and state management. I also look forward to further improving my
            development skills by following software development processes like
            Test Driven Development. In my spare time, I focus on my training
            for Track and Field, which I specialized in eight hundred meters.
